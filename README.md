# Shiny_Project

Hello! My project is based off of data from the World Trade Organization. The data includes trade information from 200 countries, with each observation detailing the flow of trade (export vs. import), the type of merchandise (such as agriculture, fuels, iron and steel,etc.) and the value of said trade in US dollars. The features in the app include a cloropleth map, two tabs to describe data from two different countries, and a fourth tab that compares the two countries. The sidebar allows you to change what you wish to see on each individual page.
